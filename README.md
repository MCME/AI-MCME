AI-MCME
=======

Allows a simple quest-line and some semi-conplex AI to work in MCME

allows the use of /say to start conversations with NPCs.

For example, if you were standing near treebeard, and did '/say Hello Treebeard' 
Treebeard might respond with 'hello, dallen1393'. 
However, '/say Hello master of ents, Treebeard' would still get treebeard's attention because it contains both hello and treebeard. Treebeard would also bring you into a private conversation with him, here is where your adventure could start. To exit the conversation, simply say 'goodbye', or 'farewell'.
